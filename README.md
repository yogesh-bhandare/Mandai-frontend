    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Mandai is a mobile app connecting farmers, vendors, and restaurants, enabling seamless trade of bulk commodities. It provides real-time market price updates, ensuring fair deals and eliminating exploitation by middlemen. Farmers can directly sell their produce to restaurants or vendors, maximizing profits, while restaurants benefit from transparent pricing and streamlined order management.

### Motivation

The lack of transparency in agricultural trading leads to unfair pricing and reduced profits for farmers. Mandai empowers farmers, ensures fair market deals, and simplifies supply chain management for all stakeholders, fostering trust and efficiency.
